# Shared Laundry Room Simulation 

This project simulates the usage of a shared laundry room located.

## ðŸ§¼ Project Objective

The main objective of this simulation is to analyze the efficiency, bottlenecks, and behavior of users in a shared laundry system. The model allows us to:
- Identify waiting time hotspots
- Optimize washer/dryer usage
- Test system behavior under various conditions
- Propose improvements based on simulation results

##  Model Overview

The model uses **discrete-event simulation** and is designed to reflect real-life use of the laundry facility, including:

- Random arrival of students (mean: 22.5 minutes, exponential distribution)
- Behavior based on actual surveys: 78% arrive without laundry, 22% with laundry
- Simulated walk time: 54s (with laundry), 7min (without laundry)
- Resource handling with capacity constraints (5 washers, 5 dryers)
- Queues with max 4 students
- Decision-making logic (wait/leave if busy)
- Breakdown simulation: random washer failure once a month

##  Experimentation

Four key experiments were conducted to evaluate system performance under different scenarios:

### 1. Extended Operating Hours
- Compared 6:00â€“22:00 vs 7:00â€“22:00
- Result: 12% fewer rejections, 15% shorter queues

### 2. Increased Washer Capacity
- Compared 5 to 8 washers
- Result: Optimal improvement at 7 washers

### 3. Arrival Probability Adjustment
- Simulated 20%, 50%, 80% arriving with laundry
- Result: Higher prep = better efficiency, shorter wait

### 4. Washer Failure
- Simulated 1 washer failure (3 hours)
- Result: Queue time +40%, 18% more students left

##  Architecture Summary

- **Event-driven simulation**: system time advances by discrete events
- **Student behavior**: generated by custom event generator
- **Resources**: managed via service units (with/without queue capacity)
- **Decisions**: dynamic based on availability, wait time tolerance, probabilities
- **Components**:
  - Queues
  - Event stack
  - Resource states (busy/free/timeslot)

##  Key Parameters (Based on Surveys)

| Scenario                     | Probability |
|-----------------------------|-------------|
| 2 washers + 2 dryers        | 15.15 %     |
| 1 washer + 1 dryer          | 27.27 %     |
| 2 washers only              | 12.12 %     |
| 2 washers + 1 dryer         | 6.06  %     |
| 1 washer only               | 27.27 %     |
| 3 washers only              | 9.09  %     |
| 3 washers + 2 dryers        | 3.03  %     |

**Washer programs**: 25, 33, 39, 41 minutes  
**Dryer programs**: 15, 22, 29, 39, 42 minutes

##  Validation & Data Source

The model was validated through:
- Direct observation at the dorm laundry
- Surveys (34 respondents)
- Field measurements (arrival intervals, process durations)
